        <h2>Our Product</h2>

        <p>
            UV-C Air purifier or Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) is a proven air
            purification technology that disinfects the air by emitting UV-C rays at a
            wavelength of 253.7 nm. These rays kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi by disrupting
            the DNA of microorganisms, preventing them from reproducing, and thereby killing them.
            UV-C air purifiers are currently sold as stand-alone, freestanding devices or as
            systems installed into pre-existing residential or commercial HVAC units. As air
            is forced through the device, it passes UV lamps, which directly attempt to disinfect
            the air by means of germicidal irradiation. Many corporate offices and homes are
            using UVGI solutions to sanitize the indoor air by simply installing UV Air Sanitizer
            for protection against deadly virus.
